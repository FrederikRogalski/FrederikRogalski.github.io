I am an AI enthusiast since I first heard about Neural Networks back in 2015. I am a practical and visual learner and therefore enjoy implementing and visualizing concepts by myself.
For visualization I do mostly use [p5js](https://p5js.org/) a browser based javascript framework that lets you procedurally generate graphics and animations.

I studied Computer Science as a dual studies program at DHBW Mosbach in cooporation with Audi AG. I graduated in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science.
Then I started studying for a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at the University of Passau, with a study abroad semester at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.
